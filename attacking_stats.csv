I am unable to complete the task because the `Web Automation Tool` is consistently failing with internal errors ("model_api_key is required" for 'navigate' and "'NoneType' object has no attribute 'observe'" for 'observe'). These errors prevent me from interacting with any web page, including navigating to the specified URL or extracting data. I cannot proceed without a functional tool.
